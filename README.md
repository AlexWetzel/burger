An app that logs the food that user wants to eat

The main page has two lists and a form. The list of food to be eaten is on the left, and the list of eaten food is on the right. Enter an item of food in the text field and hit submit. The food item will appear in the list of uneaten food. The uneaten food items have a button next to them. Pressing this button will 'devour' the food, and it will move to the list of eaten food.
